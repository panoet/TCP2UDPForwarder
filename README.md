# TCP2UDPForwarder

Simple program to forward TCP connection to UDP. I've made this program for my own purpose after looking everywhere and didn't find any that suit my needs. Hope this will be useful for others.

java -jar TCPtoUDPForwarder.jar [tcp_ip_from] [tcp_port_from] [udp_ip_to] [udp_port_to]
